					<li> In his article, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">"What is Code,"</a>
						Paul Ford discusses an in depth explanation of the nitty gritty foundational systems of code and the physical world that it encompasses. </li>
					<li> This article was written in the first-person perspective of the author, who is also a programmer, and he describes and explains the how's and why's of coding. </li>
					<li> One of the first things that Ford points out about himself is that although he is a programmer, he is not good at math. This is really interesting because being a programmer without strong math skills almost seems counterintuitive. </li>
					<li> In the section, "What's With All These Conferences, Anyway?" Ford brings up the presence of sexual harrassment towards women in the programming field. Why is it important for workplaces to have inclusive work environments, and can you describe other areas of the art/design field that exhibits inequality? </li>
					<li> In section 4.1, Ford writes that "for a truly gifted programmer, writing code is a side effect of thought. Their skill isn't in syntax; it's how they perceive time and computation. They can see the consequences of their actions more quickly than the next programmer...." What do you think it'll take to reach this level of programming? </li>
					<li> In the beginning of section 2, Ford brings up William Morris, who was discussed in part II of the History of Latin Photography lecture. Ford notes that William Morris "once said you can't have art without resistance in the materials." What are your thoughts on this statement? </li>
